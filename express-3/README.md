## Getting Started

* Fork this repo, and clone it into your `dev` folder on your local machine.

# Homework

Your homework tonight is practice.

You must do this without any copy/paste **at least 5 times**.

1. Create a directory to place a node project in.
1. Use `npm` to create a `package.json` and install `express`.
1. Add `node_modules` to a new `.gitignore` file.
1. Make a new JavaScript file which creates a new express application.
1. Create a public folder and configure Express to serve static assets.
1. Add two routes to the express application.  Use your imagination!  Your routes can return anything you want.
1. Use the browser to test that your routes display the correct data.

## Bonus

1. Add an HTML page in your project which uses server side rendering.
1. Make a route which returns JSON data.
1. Use your JSON route from your server side rendered HTML page.  (AJAX FTW)

## Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Once you've finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.

> Note: the pull-request will not be merged as other student's work would conflict.
